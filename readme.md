Eric's Sample Laravel App!

This is a very simple Laravel app I made to get started with learning Laravel.  You can
create messages in /contact and view a list of all the messages in /messages.

To run:

Download XAMPP, npm, composer

Clone this into xampp/htdocs/sampleapp

Run 'composer install', 'npm install', 'npm run dev'

Navigate to localhost/sampleapp/public
